## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Really practiced Flexbox here for the main container and each individual container. Also used a CSS reset and rem here for good practice.

### Continued development

Would like to continue practicing Flexbox to get the hang of it, as well as CSS Grid. I'm also interested in practicing more JavaScript.
